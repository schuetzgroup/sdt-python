Change log
==========

Generally, if the major version number was increased, there was an API break,
so watch out for those!


14.1
----

- Fix bug in :py:class:`fret.FrameSelector` which was triggered when the
  highest occuring frame number was divisible by the length of the excitation
  sequence.


14.0
----

- Completely reworked MSD analysis framework. This can be used on the ensemble
  level or on individual tracks. It is now easier to use and extensible
  (API break).
- Add :py:class:`nbui.ROISelector`
- Fix :py:func:`io.get_files` on Windows
- rename :py:class:`fret.FretImageSelector` -> :py:class:`FrameSelector` due to
  added ability to work on DataFrame (API break)
- Implement smFRET corrections in :py:class:`fret.SmFretAnalyzer`
- Reorganization of :py:mod:`fret` (API break):
  Rename :py:class:`fret.SmFretFilter` -> :py:class:`fret.SmFretAnalyzer` and
  move all analyzing methods from :py:class:`fret.SmFretTracker` there
- :py:class:`flatfield.Corrector`: Add option to smooth correction image
- Add :py:class:`nbui.Thresholder`
- Add (adaptive) thresholding functions to :py:mod:`image`
- Add :py:func:`image.fill_gamut`
- Port :py:class:`nbui.Locator` to ipympl and improve and fix.
- Fork https://github.com/soft-matter/slicerator into helper.slicerator as 
  development seems to have stalled. Use it instead of the external 
  slicerator.


13.4
----

- Add a function to simulate Brownian motion to :py:mod:`sim`
- Fix frame numbers (off by 1) and column names when loading ThunderSTORM
  single molecule data from CSV files
- Add the :py:mod:`funcs` module, which implement step functions and eCDFs
- Make the `lmfit` package an optional dependency
- :py:func:`gaussian_fit.gaussian_2d`: Rotate mathematically positive
- :py:class:`roi.PathROI`: Make sure that relative origin is not negative.
  Otherwise localization data will not fit the image data anymore, since
  for the latter the origin can never be negative. Fixes e.g. an issue with
  shifted localizations if the ROI in ``gui.locator`` is close to the image
  boundaries.


13.3
----

- Fix numpy 1.15 warnings
- Add support for loading ThunderSTORM CSV files
- Support flipped/mirrored channels in :py:class:`chromatic.Corrector`


13.2
----

- Add :py:class:`roi.MaskROI` supporting ROIs from boolean image arrays
- Improvements to plotting functions in the :py:mod:`fret` module
- :py:func:`motion.fit_msd`: Support anomalous diffusion (with exposure time
  correction).
- Add :py:meth:`transform` method to :py:class:`roi.PathROI`
- Add :py:func:`calc_pair_distance`
- Greatly speed up (M)SD calculation functions in :py:mod:`motion` for large
  datasets
- Speed up :py:func:`motion.find_immobilizations` and
  :py:func:`motion.find_immobilizations_int`


13.1
----

Bugfix release

- Fix loading io.yaml on Windows, where there is no `numpy.float128`
- Support ImageJ metadata in io.SdtTiffStack

----

- Add changepoint detection algorithms (PELT, offline and online Bayesian
  changepoint detection)
- Image masks: Improve :py:class:`CircleMask`, add :py:class:`RectMask`
- :py:func:`brightness.from_raw_image`: Improved background detection,
  numba-accelerated implementation

  - Add support for calculating correction image from single molecule data

- Add :py:func:`io.get_files` and :py:func:`io.chdir`
- Overhaul, improve, and extend the :py:mod:`fret` module for analyzing
  single molecule FRET data. (API break)

  - :py:class:`SmFretTracker` class for tracking and determination of
    FRET-related quantities
  - :py:class:`SmFretFilter` for filtering the data (stepwise bleaching,
    brightness, â€¦)
  - Functions for plotting the data
  - Huge speed-ups, bug fixes, etc.

- Add :py:mod:`config` module for configurable default arguments to functions.
- Add Jupyter notebook UI for finding 3D-DAOSTORM parameters
- Allow creation of ROIs using `size` as second arg instead of `bottom_right`
- Rename `reset_origin` arg to ROI classes ``__call__`` to `rel_origin`,
  introduce ``unset_origin`` function that undoes the effect of
  ``rel_origin=True`` (API break).
- Load ROIs from ImageJ ROI files
- Dump :py:class:`chromatic.Corrector` to YAML
- Add support for :py:mod:`pathlib`
- Many fixes and improvements


12.0
----
- Major reorganization (API break)

  - Move :py:mod:`data` -> :py:mod:`io`.
  - Add :py:class:`SdtSpeStack` to :py:mod:`io`.
  - Move :py:func:`image_tools.save_as_tiff` -> :py:mod:`io`.
  - Move YAML stuff to :py:mod:`io`.
  - Create :py:mod:`spacial` module for functions dealing with spacial aspects
    of single molecule data.
  - Move ROI handling into new top-level :py:mod:`roi` module.

- Improve :py:class:`brightness.Distribution` class

  - Create fast numba implementation
  - Automatic abscissa
  - Calculate kernels only where sensible (+/- 5 sigma by default)
  - Update docs
  - Rename some parameters (API break)

- :py:class:`chromatic.Corrector`: Allow callable `cval` in `__call__`
- Add numba implementation for :py:class:`brightness.from_raw_image`
- :py:meth:`fret.SmFretAnalyzer.quantify_fret` superseeds
  :py:meth:`fret.SmFretAnalyzer.efficincy` and
  :py:meth:`fret.SmFretAnalyzer.stoichiometry`.
- :py:meth:`fret.SmFretData.track`: Various improvements.
- yaml: Add `save`, `dump`, and friends so that one does not need to import
  both upstream yaml and sdt's yaml in most cases.
- :py:func:`plot.density_scatter` now returns plotted data.
- Handle empty datasets in :py:func:`plot.density_scatter`.
- Add :py:meth:`SmFretAnalyzer.has_fluorophores`.


11.1
----
- Implement transforming PathROIs using `chromatic.Corrector`
- Bug fixes

  - PathROI construction with ``no_noimage=True``
  - Empty DataFrames in `fret.SmFretData.track`
  - Empty arrays in `multicolor.find_colocalizations`


11.0
----
- Ability to tag features with near neighbors in localization data
- For smFRET tracking, (optionally) use above feature to select only
  localizations that don't have any near neighbors, otherwise the brightness
  determination will yield bogus results.
- Stop using :py:class:`pandas.Panel`. It has been deprecated in version 0.20.
  Use :py:class:`pandas.Panel` s with multi-indices for columns instead. This
  affects much of the :py:mod:`multicolor` and :py:mod:`fret` modules.
  This was used as an opportunity for more drastic redesigns of the data
  structures. (API break)
- Move SDT-control specific stuff from :py:mod:`image_tools` as well as
  :py:mod:`pims` to the external `micro_helpers` package. Since
  `locator` depends on this, the whole `sdt` package depends on `micro_helpers`
  now. (API break)
- Support .stk files in `locator`
- Add ability to only return indices in :py:func:`multicolor.merge_channels`.
- Allow for not dropping non-colocalized data in
  :py:func:`multicolor.find_colocalizations`.


Older versions
--------------

10.3
~~~~
- Add the `plot` module. It contains

  - the `density_scatter` function. It produces scatter plots (supporting both
    matplotlib and bokeh) where data points are colored according to their
    density.
  - The `NbColumnDataSource`, which is a subclass of bokeh's `ColumnDataSource`,
    but its `selected["1d"]` attribute is updated even in jupyter notebooks.
    Starting with bokeh 0.12.5, this is obsolete however since bokeh now
    supports embedding bokeh apps in notebooks (via the function handler).

- Remove unused and incomplete `plots_viewer` and `sm_fret_viewer`

10.2
~~~~
- Add classes for elliptical and rectangular path-based ROIs
- Add an `invert` option to path-based ROIs
- Implement YAML loaders and dumpers for various structures
- Add `fret` module for analyzing single molecule FRET data
- Make it possible to choose how to estimate the background in
  `brightness.from_raw_image`
- Bug fixes

10.1
~~~~
- loc.daostorm_3d: Introduce `size_range` and `min_distance` parameters
- loc.daostorm_3d: Allow for applying filters to the raw image data to increase
  the SNR for the feature finding process. Fitting is still done on the
  unmodified data.
- locator: Rework the options UI to allow easy addition of new parameters.
- Minor bug fixes

10.0
~~~~
- motion: Implement new `find_immobilizations` algorithm
- locator: Use same default directory for all file dialogs
- Port to qtpy 1.1
- Add `image.masks`
- Rename `image_filter` -> `image.filters` (API break)
- brightness: Improve `from_raw_image` performance

9.0
~~~
- Fix infinite loop in `motion.find_immobilizations`
- Minor fixes in `motion.find_immobilizations`
- Rename `background` -> `image_filter` since the module may at some point
  contain filters other than for background estimation. Also rename the
  individual filter functions (API break).
- Add many tests (and/or make sure they are run).

8.0
~~~
- Create `background` module for estimation and subtraction of background in
  fluorescence microscopy images. Unfortunately, there is no sphinx
  documentation yet since `slicerator.pipeline` does not work (yet) with
  sphinx autodoc.
- Add `motion.find_immobilizations` to find immobilized sections of particle
  trajectories.
- Fix an issue where NaNs where present in `multicolor.find_codiffusion`
  where they should not be.
- Improve `brightness.Distribution.__init__`. It now accepts also lists of
  DataFrames (but no more lists of floats) and a new `cam_eff` parameter to
  account for camera photoconversion efficiency (API break).
- Add unit tests for `image_tools`. In the course of this, some bugs were
  fixed, but also handling of ROI metadata in the `sdt.pims` classes changed;
  ROIs are now a list of dicts instead of a structured array (API break).

7.1
~~~
- Introduce the `multicolor` module. This is a better version (faster, with
  tests) of the `sm_fret` module, which is now deprecated.
- Minor fixes and improvements.

7.0
~~~
- Fix `chromatic.Corrector.__call__` when applied to `Slicerator`.
- chromatic: Allow for using multiple files and files with multiple frames for
  calculation of the correction parameters in `Corrector` (slight API break:
  The `feat1` and `feat2` attributes are now lists of DataFrames, not
  plain DataFrames anymore.)
- helper.singleton: Add a singleton type class decorator. Based on
  https://github.com/reyoung/singleton
- Minor GUI and plotting tweaks
- data, motion: Be more consistent with naming of things (e. g. use "lagt"
  everywhere and not also sometimes "tlag", make all variable names lower case,
  ...) (API break)
- Fix crash in loc.daostorm_3d in images without localizations

6.1
~~~
- Fix start-up of sdt.gui.locator on Windows

6.0

~~~
- Use full affine transformation in chromatic. This also leads to a different
  save file format etc. (API break, file format break)
