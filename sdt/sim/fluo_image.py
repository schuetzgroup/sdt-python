    """Simulate an image from multiple Gaussian PSFs

    Given a list of coordinates, amplitudes and sigmas, simulate a fluorescent
    image. This is a frontend to the lower level functions
    :py:func:`gauss_psf_numba`, :py:func:`gauss_psf`, and
    :py:func:`gauss_psf_full`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape : tuple of int, len=2
        Shape of the output image. First entry is the width, second is the
        height.
    centers : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n, 2)
        Coordinates of the PSF centers
    amplitudes : array_like
        Amplitudes of the PSFs. Either a scalar that is used for all Gaussians
        or an 1D array specifying the amplitude for each Gaussian. See also
        the `mass` parameter.
    sigmas : array_like
        If it is one number, this will be used as sigma for all Gaussians. An
        array of two numbers will be interpreted as sigmas in x and y
        directions for all Gaussians. A one-dimensional array of length n
        can be used to specify sigma for each Gaussian, and a 2D array of shape
        (n, 2) gives sigmas in x and y directions for each Gaussian.
    cutoff : float, optional
        Each Gaussian is only calculated in a box `cutoff` times sigma pixels
        around the center. Does not apply if `engine` is "python_full".
        Defaults to 5.
    mass : bool, optional
        If True, the value(s) given by `amplitude` are the integrated
        Gaussians. If False, they are amplitudes. Defaults to False.
    engine : {"numba", "python", "python_full"}, optional
        "numba" is a :py:mod:`numba`-optimized version, which is by far the
        fastest. "python" is written in pure python. "python_full" is also
        pure python and calculates each Gaussian for the whole image
        (not only in a region around the center, where it is significant),
        which makes it the slowest. Defaults to "numba".

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Simulated image.
